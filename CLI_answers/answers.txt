Hello these are my CLI challange answers:
1-  For creating a hidden folder we can add a dot (.) at the front of folder name. Like as: mkdir .CLI_answers
    We can use ls -a command for displaying of hidden folders.
2-  For making to create multiple nested directories, we can use mkdir -p this/is/a/new/directory command.
3-  I used echo "text" >> textfilename.txt comment.
